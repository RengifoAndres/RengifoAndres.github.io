## Hi there!

Iâ€™m an Economist interested in Causal Inference, Econometrics, Data Science and Labor Economics. This is my **website**.

Currently, I am a Senior Research Associate at Good Business Lab Latin America. Previously I was a research assistant at Harvard Business School. I also worked at the Business Department at Universidad de los Andes.

I hold an MSc in Economics from Universidad de los Andes and a Bachelorâ€™s degree from Universidad del Valle.

In addition to research, I find great joy in teaching. I was the Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course Big Data and Machine Learning at Universidad de los Andes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with firm's administrative data to understant how to improve managerial practices.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new Big Data and Machine Learning techniques and how to apply them to interesting Economic questions.
- ðŸ’¬ Have an idea and want to collaborate, fell free to send me an email.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I want to be a writer, but with the advent of AI, I donâ€™t know if there will still be room for a humanâ€”imperfect and messyâ€”writer.
