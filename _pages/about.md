About 
======
Welcome! I am an Economist interested in Causal Inference, Econometrics, and Data Science. I work as a Research Assistant at Harvard Business School, and I previously worked in the Business Department at Universidad de los Andes. I received my MSc in Economics from Universidad de los Andes and my Bachelor's degree from Universidad del Valle.

I also enjoy teaching. Currently I am teaching assistant for the course BIG DATA AND MACHINE LEARNING at Universidad de los Andes.
